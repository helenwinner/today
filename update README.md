 User Documentation, also known as End-user Documentation, refers to the documentation for a product or service provided to the end users. It aims in providing information about the product. Also, this is often referred to as user assistance.

 It could be based on a product or a service provided or a complete end to the end project documentation, that directly helps the end user.

Technically speaking, a useful user document should have all documentation and essentials that are required and related to the entire product cycle. The user documentation is a part of the overall product delivered to the customer; end-to-end.

 It starts from the initiation phase to the closure, ie, end to end product life cycle.

## The primary and most essential criteria of a person who wants to write an IDEAL USER DOCUMENT/ DOCUMENTATION is, the writer has to understand the technology it describes completely.

# Types of User Documentation

There are basically 3 types of user documentation written for different users and their purposes.

###Description Document –
gives a detailed overview of the product with all the services offered by the product. End-users read this document and decide if this the product he is looking for or not.

### Installation and Setup –
has detailed information on installing & setting up the product and how to operate the product.

# Difference Between Technical Documentation and User Documentation

There are mainly 2 key differences. Before we push in further into the best examples, let us see these differences.

Usually, a technical writer or a team of technical writers are responsible for compiling the technical documentation. The main agenda of this team is to contribute effectively to the formalized document for the technicians. Technical Documentation is not shared externally.

Whereas user documentation is shared to all users and it emphasizes on the fact that all technical detailing may not be productive or necessary for the user. Hence they provide a user-friendly that provides effective knowledge on the product for its beneficial usage.

### Usually, a User Documentation Consists of:

User manuals
FAQ
Step by step guides
Videos of the product
Product Demos
Pre-launch publishing
Embedded assistance
Online chart portals
Support Teams with hotlines
